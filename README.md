### Thesis B - Determining of satellite properties, such as size and brightness, from telescope imagery

This project is the thesis I'm working on, which is on the classification of satellite properties (such as size and brightness) from telescope imagery, using techniques like image processing and aperture photometry. 

Core Libraries: 
* Astropy
* Photutils

Key Features: 
* Image procesing
* Background noise removal
* Aperture photometry
* Light curve extraction
